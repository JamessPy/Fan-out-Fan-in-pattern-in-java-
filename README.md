# Fan-out-Fan-in-pattern-in-java-
The fan-out/fan-in pattern in Java is a frequently used approach in large-scale data processing applications. In this example, I used this approach to find the 'WARN' and 'ERROR' numbers in a 1.1GB log file. Given the vastly larger log sizes available today, developing such approaches is inevitable.

Here I discussed the single thread and multithread structure with fan-out/fan-in structure and the results are like this.
